Step 1: create a Directory
Step 2: In that directory: use Terminal to Enter:    npm init
  that creates package.json
Refer to sample package.json : add the start stanza:
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    
Make index.js file : put in the starter code for the application 
  https://github.com/computationalknowledge/PetersONLINEEmporium/blob/main/index.js
  
Do npm i  on required NPMJS.com packages

Then run     npm start      and application should start:
Then you can     npm publish   to submit your app to npmjs.com
Then Do the Happy Dance to Celebrate.
